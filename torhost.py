	It appears that Tor does some kind of buffering and isn't completely in sync
	with the sockets we have open. Specifically if we send data to a client and
	then immediately kill Tor the data will still be inside Tor's buffers and
	fail to send. I've only been able to reproduce the problem with keep-alive
	mode turned off, so the delay is pretty small. Pausing a couple seconds
	before killing Tor seems to solve the issue entirely.
